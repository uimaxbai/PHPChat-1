# PHPChat
phpchat.gq - a secure messaging solution!
### A (increasingly less) simple, no faff chat service.


## Privacy
no longer can we stand for the data harvesting of big companies

we do not and will never sell your data, or distibute unless required

## Data storage
we use logs to store chat logs (phpchat.gq/log.html)
we also use mysqlremote to save user data such as passwords
speaking of passwords, they are encrypted securely

## Issues
if an issue ever arises, please report on the issue page
we can delete or alter account data if needed

thank you and please feel free to make a pull request!
